# Development Setup

## Build system

The project uses gradle. 
The gradle wrapper is included in the source code so just a java vm is required. However since it is a Java 8 + Java 11 multi release build both versions are needed.
 

## General Requirements



## My setup

## Native

 * visual studio

## Java

 * Java 8 JDK + JavaFX
 * Java 11 JDK (without JavaFX)
 
 I use the zulu fx packages (https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk-fx)
